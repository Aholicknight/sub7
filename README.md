# Sub7

This is the complete source code to **Sub7 2.1.3 Bonus**,written in Delphi by mobman and released June 2, 2000. I recieved this source code directly from mobman after extensive OSINT within the past 5 years to find mobman, which i wrote about [::HERE::](https://www.illmob.org/notmymobman/). This source code will be released to coincide with my talk at [BSidesCT](https://www.bsidesct.org/) later this year.

## History
Sub7 or SubSeven is a (RAT) Remote Access Trojan horse program originally released in 1999. Its name was derived by spelling NetBus backwards ("suBteN") and swapping "ten" with "seven" by a Romanian coder with the moniker '_mobman_'. 
SubSeven v.2.1.3 BONUS by mobman was a backdoor program that allowed others to gain full access to Windows 9X systems through a network connection. It consisted of 3 different components:
- Client (SubSeven.exe): GUI used to connect to the server over the network.
- Server (server.exe): The backdoor to run on the victim machine.
- EditServer (EditServer.exe): Edits the server with custom settings before deployment.
